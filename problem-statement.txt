Day 7 & 8 - Quiz 3

Baseline:

Create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with 4-hidden layers to solve the classification problem on the "Fashion MNIST" Dataset. 

Link to dataset: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/fashion_mnist/load_data

Requirements:

A. Make use of the Tensorboard to dump training/test data - both scalars and images.

B. Perform an ablation study:

After creating the ANN, analyse how the accuracy changes when -

You decrease or increase the number of hidden layers.
You decrease or increase the number of neurons per layer.
